# Abstract

We propose a new model---the Urban Mental Health Model---for inclusion
in the InVEST suite to estimate how urban nature (e.g., greenspaces)
contributes to improved mental health outcomes. This model addresses a
key technical gap in the current InVEST toolkit by directly linking
nature exposure to mental health outcomes such as depression and anxiety
using effect sizes derived from recent meta-analyses [[(Liu et al.
2023)]{.underline}](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?qmGvGj)(Li et
al., 2025). The model relies on widely available global
datasets---including NDVI, tree canopy cover, land use and land cover,
gridded population, and baseline mental health prevalence rates---making
it applicable to cities worldwide. The basis for the model has been
tested in several research case studies, including in San Francisco and
Italy [[(Giannico et al.
2024)]{.underline}](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?UdWRjb),
demonstrating its ability to estimate preventable mental health cases
and associated societal cost savings under alternative greening
scenarios. This tool also builds upon and extends the Urban Nature
Access model by providing quantitative estimates of health benefits,
supporting more targeted and equity-informed urban planning. Interest in
this model is growing rapidly across global partners, including the
Global Gross Ecosystem Product (GEP) project. While already operational
as a standalone module (See the [[design
doc]{.underline}](./pep-0013/invest-mental-health-model-design-doc-v0.3.0.docx),
full integration into InVEST will enhance usability, allow batch
processing, and improve accessibility for a global audience. This
proposal falls under the category of model development.

# Motivation

A core motivation behind the development of the InVEST model suite is to
empower decision-makers and urban planners with tools to quantify how
different forms of natural capital---such as water bodies, forests, and
parks---support human well-being through ecosystem services like carbon
sequestration, urban cooling, and flood risk reduction. These insights
enable governments and organizations to make informed, strategic
investments in nature that sustain and enhance the flow of benefits to
people over time.

However, there is currently no InVEST model that explicitly quantifies
the mental health benefits provided by urban nature. Given the
increasing recognition of mental health as a critical component of
public health---and the growing body of evidence linking greenspace
exposure to improved mental well-being---this represents a significant
gap among the InVEST models [[(Bratman et al.
2019)]{.underline}](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?wMb8gY). The
proposed Urban Mental Health Model addresses this need by providing a
mechanism for cities to assess how changes in urban greening can
influence population-level mental health outcomes and reduce societal
healthcare costs related to mental disorders. By offering spatially
explicit estimates of these benefits, the model can inform more
targeted, equitable, and cost-effective urban greening strategies.

This model builds on and complements the Urban Nature Access model,
which evaluates the spatial distribution of greenspace supply relative
to population demand within cities. While the Access model identifies
areas with over- or under-provision of greenspace, it does not link this
access to concrete health outcomes such as depression or anxiety. The
model fills this critical gap by providing a direct, quantifiable link
between residential greenspace exposure and mental health benefits,
offering a novel contribution to the InVEST toolkit (criterion:
novelty).

Ultimately, this model will help cities better design, prioritize, and
implement urban nature interventions that advance both environmental and
public health goals---especially in underserved communities where green
infrastructure investment can yield the greatest human impact.

## Novelty:

Previous InVEST models provide estimates of existing ecosystem services
and can also create scenarios for future changes. However, the potential
effect of current and future ecosystem services on human health is not a
part of output from the models. Instead, this has to be inferred but
using other data and science linking ecosystem services to human health
outcomes. The InVEST Urban Mental Health Model will be the first InVEST
model that can directly measure the effect of existing and changes in
ecosystem services like urban nature on human health, in this case
mental health.

The estimates for the association between greenspace indexes and mental
health outcomes is based on comprehensive meta-analyses of studies that
have been published in peer-reviewed scientific journals [[(Rojas-Rueda
et al. 2019; Liu et al.
2023)]{.underline}](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?1xcg1S). The
model provides users with three flexible options for estimating changes
in nature exposure and the associated health outcomes, allowing
adaptation to a variety of planning and research contexts. For example,
users can define a tree cover target to simulate a greening scenario, in
which tree canopy cover and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index
(NDVI) serve as the primary inputs. Alternatively, users may provide
baseline and future (or counterfactual) land use/land cover (LULC) maps
to estimate changes in nature exposure based on projected or proposed
landscape transformations.

Users can select a range of mental health outcomes---such as depression
or anxiety as outcomes in the model. These outcomes are assessed using
widely recognized clinical and self-report instruments. For example, the
exemplified depression indicator was measured using the Center for
Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D), the Patient Health
Questionnaire (PHQ), the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) criteria, the Geriatric Depression
Scale (GDS), the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), the Hospital Anxiety
and Depression Scale---Depression subscale (HADS-D), the
Four-Dimensional Symptom Questionnaire (4DSQ), and the Inventory of
Depressive Symptomatology (IDS). These validated tools allow for robust
and comparable assessments of mental health across diverse populations
and study contexts.

## Usability:

To maximize the model's usability and global applicability, we have
designed the Urban Mental Health Model to rely primarily on publicly
available and widely used datasets. This ensures that users from a
variety of institutional, geographic, and technical backgrounds can
apply the model with minimal barriers. Below, we describe the core input
data required to run the model:

- **Administrative boundaries (vector)**: A polygon layer representing
  the spatial units for analysis. These can range from an entire city to
  subdivisions such as neighborhoods, districts, or census tracts. This
  spatial structure enables aggregation and comparison of population
  exposure and health outcomes.

- **Spatial population data (raster)**: Global population datasets such
  as WorldPop (www.worldpop.org) offer gridded population estimates at
  resolutions as fine as 100 meters. More localized datasets may also be
  used to improve accuracy and context relevance.

- **NDVI (raster)**: NDVI serves as the core proxy for nature exposure
  in the model. Freely available from multiple sources, including Google
  Earth Engine, MODIS
  (https://modis.gsfc.nasa.gov/data/dataprod/mod13.php), and Sentinel-2,
  NDVI data capture the relative abundance and density of vegetation
  across the study area.

- **Tree canopy cover (raster)**: Tree cover provides an additional
  measure of green infrastructure and exposure quality. Global datasets
  such as the Global Tree Canopy Cover Version 4
  (https://gee-community-catalog.org/projects/global_tcc/) offer
  consistent and free access to tree canopy estimates at high
  resolution.

- **LULC data (raster or vector):** These datasets offer additional
  context on greenspace types and urban environments. Sources include
  national datasets like NLCD for the U.S. (https://www.mrlc.gov/data)
  and global sources such as ESA WorldCover
  (https://esa-worldcover.org/), which provide LULC information at high
  spatial resolution.

- **Baseline health risk data (vector)**: Spatially explicit prevalence
  rates for mental health outcomes (e.g., depression, anxiety,) are
  essential for calculating preventable cases. These can be obtained
  from local or national health agencies such as the Centers for Disease
  Control and Prevention (CDC), or global sources where available. If
  health data are in tabular format, they can be joined to the
  corresponding spatial administrative units. Where high-resolution data
  are unavailable, users may apply rates from broader regional levels as
  approximations.

- **Health effect size table (.csv or .xlsx)**: We provide example
  effect sizes derived from a global meta-analysis, including measures
  such as risk ratios or odds ratios for various outcomes. Users are
  encouraged to substitute these with region-specific dose-response
  functions where available, to reflect local epidemiological data.

- **Health cost table (.csv or .xlsx)**: To estimate economic benefits,
  we include a sample data with country- and illness-specific societal
  costs per case (in 2018 USD PPP). Users may input more detailed, local
  cost estimates if available. For global or cross-country comparisons,
  we recommend harmonizing cost units to ensure consistency across
  regions.

Thanks to the use of open-access and globally available datasets, this
model is applicable to the vast majority of cities worldwide. Further
guidance on required and optional inputs is available in the model's
Design Document, referenced under the Specification section.

## Demonstrated interest:

The overarching goal of the InVEST model suite is to "map and value the
goods and services from nature that sustain and fulfill human life." To
date, InVEST models have enabled users to quantify several ecosystem
services, for example, coastal flood mitigation, soil retention, and
urban cooling. While these outputs can be used to infer potential
benefits to human health, doing so requires users to possess
domain-specific knowledge and access to external datasets that link
environmental changes to health outcomes. This limits broader
accessibility and undercuts the integrated decision-support value InVEST
seeks to provide. The proposed Urban Mental Health Model aims to close
this gap by directly estimating the relationship between urban nature
and mental health outcomes. This is a timely and critical addition. Poor
mental health imposes a substantial burden globally, with estimated
costs reaching \$5 trillion USD per year by 2019---approximately 3.8% of
global GDP [[(Arias et al.
2022)]{.underline}](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?4wI9bc)---and
this burden is expected to continue rising. Urban green space, including
street tree biodiversity and neighborhood greenness, has been
consistently linked to improved mental health outcomes, such as reduced
antidepressant usage [[(Stenfors et al.
2024)]{.underline}](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?4MfSsr). By
modeling these relationships, the new InVEST module will allow planners,
researchers, and decision-makers to quantify how investments in urban
nature can mitigate mental health challenges at both neighborhood and
city scales.

There is strong and growing interest in such a model, both within the
Natural Capital Project and among external collaborators. Key urban
planning and conservation questions---such as where changes in urban
nature will influence mental health and whom they will benefit---can be
addressed more directly with this tool. The preliminary framework has
been applied to urban projects in Guangzhou [[(World Bank
2022)]{.underline}](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?S7hbhx), San
Francisco (on going), and Italy [[(Giannico et al.
2024)]{.underline}](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?XfGr83), and
interest has expanded beyond our immediate network. For example,
participants in InVEST training workshops in 2023 and 2024 from diverse
global institutions expressed keen interest in the model's release.
Notably, there has been a formal request to include this model in the
Global Gross Ecosystem Product (GEP) project led by Steve Polasky---a
collaborative effort where we have committed to providing this
functionality.

A beta version of the model was previously developed by the urban team.
While this version is functional and has been piloted in small-scale
applications, it suffers from limited computational efficiency,
unresolved bugs, and low transparency in implementation. As such, it is
not yet suitable for wide-scale adoption or integration with the broader
InVEST suite. There is a clear and pressing need for a robust,
well-documented, and user-friendly version of the Urban Mental Health
Model. Importantly, its development aligns with prior commitments we've
made to funders and partners, and it represents a natural evolution of
InVEST's capacity to support equitable, health-oriented urban
sustainability planning.

## Credibility:

The Urban Mental Health Model builds on a growing body of empirical
evidence and has been developed and tested through multiple case
studies, demonstrating both its scientific rigor and practical
applicability.

The model was first applied in a published case study in Italy
[[(Giannico et al.
2024)]{.underline}](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?rR76WQ), which
estimated preventable premature deaths by increasing residential green
space using open-access greenness data (e.g., NDVI). This study
supported the framework's ability to quantify health outcomes from urban
nature exposure and was published in the high-impact journal Nature
Communications, lending credibility to the model's scientific
foundations.

A second case study---currently underway in San Francisco, USA and led
by Yingjie Li---further refines the model to estimate preventable cases
of depression and the associated avoided healthcare costs resulting from
increased neighborhood greenness. This work builds upon the Italy
framework with enhanced methods and a broader set of input variables. A
manuscript describing this application is currently in preparation (Li
et al., in prep.).

Additionally, an earlier version of the model was applied in Guangzhou,
China [[(World Bank
2022)]{.underline}](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?k3kdyq). That
predecessor model used a fixed effect size derived from a single
empirical study and was not capable of estimating preventable cases or
monetized health benefits. In contrast, the current proposed model
improves substantially upon this early version by incorporating a
meta-analytic effect size from multiple studies, the ability to estimate
spatially explicit preventable mental health cases, and integration of
country-specific healthcare cost parameters for over 40 countries.

We are also working in collaboration with the NatCap TEEMs (The
Earth-Economy Modelers) team at the University of Minnesota to ensure
accurate and consistent incorporation of health cost indicators. These
enhancements enable the model to support comparisons across different
urban greening scenarios, providing planners and policymakers with
actionable estimates of both health and economic co-benefits.

# **Support**

The Urban Mental Health Model is expected to require only minimal
ongoing support, consistent with the maintenance needs of most InVEST
models. Notably, the model\'s input data---such as LULC and demographic
layers---are not expected to require frequent updates, enabling stable,
long-term use without annual revisions. We provided sample effect size
data for depression and anxiety based on global meta-analyses. As time
and funding permit, our team may expand this dataset. Users are
encouraged to update the health effect size table to reflect other
health indicators or incorporate more granular local data, allowing for
flexible and context-specific applications.

To support user adoption, a new entry will be added to the InVEST User's
Guide, and a sample dataset---based on completed case studies such as
San Francisco---can be provided to facilitate testing and onboarding.

Although the model has not yet been featured in formal training
workshops, aside from general announcements about its development,
dedicated training materials will be needed to support its inclusion in
the InVEST MOOC and other educational or capacity-building sessions.
